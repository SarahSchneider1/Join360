IF YOU OBJECT, YOUR PERSONAL DATA WILL THEN NO LONGER BE USED FOR DIRECT ADVERTISING PURPOSES (OBJECTION ACCORDING TO ART. 21 PARA. 2 GDPR).</p>
        <h3>Right to Lodge a Complaint with the Competent Supervisory Authority</h3>
        <p>In the event of violations of the GDPR, data subjects have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, particularly in the member state of their habitual residence, their place of work, or the place of the alleged violation.

        <h3>Right to Data Portability</h3>
        <p>You have the right to have data that we process automatically based on your consent or in fulfillment of a contract handed over to you or a third party in a common, machine-readable format.

        <h3>Information, Deletion, and Correction</h3>
        <p>You have the right, within the framework of the applicable legal provisions, to free information about your stored personal data, its origin and recipients, and the purpose of the data processing and, if applicable, a right to correction or deletion of this data at any time. You can contact us at any time for this purpose and for further questions on the subject of personal data.</p>
        <h3>Right to Restriction of Processing</h3>
        <p>You have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data. You can contact us at any time for this purpose. The right to restriction of processing exists in the following cases:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>If you contest the accuracy of your personal data stored by us, we generally need time to verify this. For the duration of the verification, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.</li>
          <li>If the processing of your personal data happened/is happening unlawfully, you can request the restriction of data processing instead of deletion.</li>
          <li>If we no longer need your personal data, but you need it for the exercise, defense, or assertion of legal claims, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data instead of deletion.</li>
          <li>If you have lodged an objection according to Art. 21 para. 1 GDPR, a balance must be struck between your interests and ours. As long as it has not yet been determined whose interests prevail, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.</li>

        <h3>SSL or TLS Encryption</h3>
        <p>For security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content, such as orders or inquiries that you send to us as the site operator, this site uses SSL or TLS encryption. You can recognize an encrypted connection by the fact that the address line of the browser changes from "http://" to "https://" and by the lock symbol in your browser line.</p>
        <p>If SSL or TLS encryption is activated, the data you transmit to us cannot be read by third parties.</p>
        <h3>Objection to Advertising Emails</h3>
        <p>The use of contact data published within the framework of the imprint obligation for the transmission of advertising and information materials not expressly requested is hereby rejected. The operators of the pages expressly reserve the right to take legal action in the event of unsolicited sending of advertising information, such as spam emails.</p>
        <h2>4. Data Collection on this Website</h2>
        <h3>Cookies</h3>
        <p>Our Internet pages use so-called "cookies." Cookies are small data packets and do not cause any damage to your end device. They are stored either temporarily for the duration of a session (session cookies) or permanently (permanent cookies) on your end device. Session cookies are automatically deleted at the end of your visit. Permanent cookies remain stored on your end device until you delete them yourself or an automatic solution is provided by your web browser.</p>
        <p>Cookies can originate from us (first-party cookies) or from third-party companies (so-called third-party cookies). Third-party cookies enable the integration of certain services of third-party companies within websites (e.g., cookies for processing payment services).</p>
        <p>Cookies have various functions. Numerous cookies are technically necessary because certain website functions would not work without them (e.g., the shopping cart function or the display of videos). Other cookies can be used to evaluate user behavior or for advertising purposes.</p>
        <p>Cookies that are necessary for the electronic communication process (necessary cookies) or for providing certain functions that you have requested (functional cookies, e.g., for the shopping cart function) or for optimizing the website (e.g., cookies for measuring the web audience) are stored on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR, unless another legal basis is specified. The website operator has a legitimate interest in storing cookies for the technically error-free and optimized provision of its services. If consent to the storage of cookies and comparable recognition technologies has been requested, the processing takes place exclusively on the basis of this consent (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR and § 25 para. 1 TTDSG); the consent can be revoked at any time.</p>
        <p>You can set your browser so that you are informed about the setting of cookies and allow cookies only in individual cases, exclude the acceptance of cookies for certain cases or in general, and activate the automatic deletion of cookies when closing the browser. If cookies are deactivated, the functionality of this website may be restricted.</p>
        <p>You can find out which cookies and services are used on this website in this privacy policy.</p>
        <h3>Server Log Files</h3>

        <p>This data is collected based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. The website operator has a legitimate interest in the technically error-free presentation and optimization of its website – for this purpose, the server log files must be recorded.</p>
        <h3>Contact Form</h3>
        <p>If you send us inquiries via the contact form, your details from the inquiry form, including the contact details you provide there, will be stored by us to process the inquiry and in case of follow-up questions. We do not pass on this data without your consent.</p>
        <p>This data processing is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR, if your request is related to the fulfillment of a contract or is necessary for the implementation of pre-contractual measures. In all other cases, the processing is based on our legitimate interest in the effective processing of the inquiries directed to us (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR) or on your consent (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR) if this has been requested; the consent can be revoked at any time.</p>
        <p>The data you enter in the contact form will remain with us until you request deletion, revoke your consent to storage, or the purpose for data storage no longer applies (e.g., after your request has been processed). Mandatory statutory provisions – especially retention periods – remain unaffected.</p>
        <h3>Inquiry by Email, Phone, or Fax</h3>
        <p>If you contact us by email, phone, or fax, your inquiry, including all resulting personal data (name, inquiry), will be stored and processed by us for the purpose of processing your request. We do not pass on this data without your consent.</p>
        <p>This data processing is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR, if your request is related to the fulfillment of a contract or is necessary for the implementation of pre-contractual measures.

        <h2>5. Analysis Tools and Advertising</h2>
        <h3>Google Analytics</h3>
        <p>This website uses functions of the web analysis service Google Analytics. The provider is Google Ireland Limited ("Google"), Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland.</p>
        <p>Google Analytics enables the website operator to analyze the behavior of website visitors. The website operator receives various usage data, such as page views, duration of stay, operating systems used, and origin of the user. Google may combine this data with other data about the user that it has stored elsewhere. This could be used to create profiles of users and identify individual users.</p>
        <p>Google Analytics uses technologies that enable the user to be recognized for the purpose of analyzing user behavior (e.g., cookies or device fingerprinting). The information collected by Google about the use of this website is usually transmitted to a Google server in the USA and stored there.</p>
        <p>The use of this service is based on your consent according to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR and § 25 para. 1 TTDSG. The consent can be revoked at any time.</p>
        <p>The transfer of data to the USA is based on the standard contractual clauses of the EU Commission. Details can be found here: <a href="https://privacy.google.com/businesses/controllerterms/mccs/">https://privacy.google.com/businesses/controllerterms/mccs/</a>.</p>
        <h4>IP Anonymization</h4>
        <p>We have activated the IP anonymization function on this website. This means that your IP address is shortened by Google within member states of the European Union or in other contracting states of the Agreement on the European Economic Area before transmission to the USA. Only in exceptional cases is the full IP address transmitted to a Google server in the USA and shortened there. On behalf of the operator of this website, Google will use this information to evaluate your use of the website, to compile reports on website activity, and to provide other services related to website activity and internet usage for the website operator. The IP address transmitted by your browser as part of Google Analytics will not be merged with other data from Google.</p>
        <h4>Browser Plugin</h4>
        <p>You can prevent Google from collecting and processing your data by downloading and installing the browser plugin available at the following link: <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en</a>.</p>
        <p>More information on how Google Analytics handles user data can be found in Google's privacy policy: <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245?hl=en">https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245?hl=en</a>.</p>
        <h4>Order Processing</h4>
        <p>We have entered into an order processing agreement with Google and fully implement the strict requirements of the German data protection authorities when using Google Analytics.</p>
        <h4>Storage Duration</h4>
        <p>Data stored by Google at user and event level, which is linked to cookies, user IDs (e.g., User ID), or advertising IDs (e.g., DoubleClick cookies, Android advertising ID), will be anonymized or deleted after 14 months. Details can be found at the following link: <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/7667196?hl=en">https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/7667196?hl=en</a>.</p>
        <h3>Google Ads</h3>
        <p>The website operator uses Google Ads. Google Ads is an online advertising program from Google Ireland Limited ("Google"), Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland.</p>
        <p>Google Ads allows us to display advertisements in the Google search engine or on third-party websites when the user enters certain search terms on Google (keyword targeting). Furthermore, targeted advertisements can be played out based on the user data available at Google (e.g., location data and interests) (target group targeting). As website operators, we can evaluate this data quantitatively by analyzing, for example, which search terms led to the display of our advertisements and how many ads led to corresponding clicks.</p>
        <p>The use of this service is based on your consent according to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR and § 25 para. 1 TTDSG. The consent can be revoked at any time.</p>
        <h3>Google Conversion Tracking</h3>
        <p>This website uses Google Conversion Tracking. The provider is Google Ireland Limited ("Google"), Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland.</p>
        <p>With the help of Google conversion tracking, we and Google can recognize whether the user has performed certain actions. For example, we can evaluate which buttons on our website were clicked how often and which products were viewed or purchased particularly frequently. This information is used to create conversion statistics. We learn the total number of users who clicked on our ads and what actions they performed. We do not receive any information with which we can personally identify the user. Google itself uses cookies or comparable recognition technologies for identification purposes.</p>
        <p>The use of this service is based on your consent according to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR and § 25 para. 1 TTDSG. The consent can be revoked at any time.</p>
        <p>More information on Google Conversion Tracking can be found in Google's privacy policy: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en">https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en</a>.</p>
        <h3>DoubleClick</h3>
        <p>This website uses features of Google DoubleClick. The provider is Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland ("DoubleClick").</p>
        <p>DoubleClick is used to show you interest-based ads across the Google advertising network. The ads can be tailored to the interests of the viewer with the help of DoubleClick. For example, our ads may appear in Google search results or in banners associated with DoubleClick.</p>
        <p>To be able to show users interest-based advertising, DoubleClick must recognize the respective viewer and be able to associate them with the web pages visited, clicks, and other information on user behavior. To do this, DoubleClick uses cookies or comparable recognition technologies (e.g., device fingerprinting). The information collected is merged into a pseudonymous user profile so that the respective user is shown interest-based advertising.</p>
        <p>Google DoubleClick is used in the interest of targeted advertising measures. This constitutes a legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. If corresponding consent has been requested (e.g., consent to the storage of cookies), the processing takes place exclusively on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR and § 25 para. 1 TTDSG; the consent can be revoked at any time.</p>
        <p>You can set your browser so that it no longer stores cookies. However, this may result in limited accessibility of the website's functions. It should also be noted that DoubleClick may also use other technologies to create user profiles. Disabling cookies therefore does not provide any guarantee against the creation of user profiles.</p>
        <p>More information on how to object to the ads displayed by Google can be found at the following links: <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads">https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads</a> and <a href="https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated">https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated</a>.</p>
        <h2>6. Newsletter</h2>
        <h3>Newsletter Data</h3>
        <p>If you would like to receive the newsletter offered on the website, we need an email address from you as well as information that allows us to verify that you are the owner of the specified email address and agree to receive the newsletter. Further data is not collected or is only collected on a voluntary basis. We use this data exclusively for sending the requested information and do not pass it on to third parties.</p>
        <p>The processing of the data entered in the newsletter registration form is based exclusively on your consent (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR). You can revoke your consent to the storage of the data, the email address, and their use for sending the newsletter at any time, for example, via the "unsubscribe" link in the newsletter. The legality of the data processing operations already carried out remains unaffected by the revocation.</p>
        <p>The data you provide us with for the purpose of receiving the newsletter will be stored by us or the newsletter service provider until you unsubscribe from the newsletter and will be deleted from the newsletter distribution list after you unsubscribe from the newsletter. Data that has been stored by us for other purposes remains unaffected.</p>
        <p>After you have been removed from the newsletter distribution list, your email address may be stored by us or the newsletter service provider in a blacklist if such an action is necessary to prevent future mailings. The data from the blacklist will only be used for this purpose and will not be merged with other data. This serves both your interest and our interest in complying with legal requirements when sending newsletters (legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR). The storage in the blacklist is indefinite. You can object to the storage if your interests outweigh our legitimate interest.</p>
        <h3>MailChimp</h3>
        <p>This website uses the services of MailChimp to send newsletters. The provider is Rocket Science Group LLC, 675 Ponce De Leon Ave NE, Suite 5000, Atlanta, GA 30308, USA.</p>
        <p>MailChimp is a service with which, among other things, the sending of newsletters can be organized and analyzed. If you enter data for the purpose of receiving the newsletter (e.g., email address), it will be stored on MailChimp's servers in the USA.</p>
        <p>MailChimp is certified under the "EU-US Data Privacy Framework." The Data Privacy Framework is an agreement between the European Union (EU) and the USA that ensures compliance with European data protection standards for data processing in the USA. MailChimp is also certified under ISO 27001, an internationally recognized information security standard. This means that your data will be treated confidentially and stored securely.</p>
        <p>With the help of MailChimp, we can analyze our newsletter campaigns. When you open an email sent with MailChimp, a file contained in the email (so-called web beacon) connects to the MailChimp servers in the USA. This way, it can be determined whether a newsletter message has been opened and which links, if any, have been clicked. In addition, technical information is recorded (e.g., time of retrieval, IP address, browser type, and operating system). This information cannot be assigned to the respective newsletter recipient. It is used exclusively for the statistical analysis of newsletter campaigns. The results of these analyses can be used to better adapt future newsletters to the interests of the recipients.</p>
        <p>If you do not want MailChimp to analyze your data, you must unsubscribe from the newsletter. For this purpose, we provide a corresponding link in every newsletter message. Furthermore, you can unsubscribe from the newsletter directly on the website.</p>
        <p>The data processing is based on your consent (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR). You can revoke this consent at any time by unsubscribing from the newsletter. The legality of the data processing operations already carried out remains unaffected by the revocation.</p>
        <p>The data you have provided us with for the purpose of receiving the newsletter will be stored by us or the newsletter service provider until you unsubscribe from the newsletter and will be deleted from the newsletter distribution list after you unsubscribe from the newsletter. Data that has been stored by us for other purposes remains unaffected.</p>
        <p>After you have been removed from the newsletter distribution list, your email address may be stored by us or the newsletter service provider in a blacklist if such an action is necessary to prevent future mailings. The data from the blacklist will only be used for this purpose and will not be merged with other data. This serves both your interest and our interest in complying with legal requirements when sending newsletters (legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR). The storage in the blacklist is indefinite. You can object to the storage if your interests outweigh our legitimate interest.</p>

        <h2>8. Own Services</h2>
        <h3>Handling Applicant Data</h3>
        <p>We offer you the opportunity to apply to us (e.g., by email, by post, or via an online application form). In the following, we inform you about the scope, purpose, and use of your personal data collected during the application process. We assure you that the collection, processing, and use of your data will take place in accordance with the applicable data protection law and all other legal provisions and that your data will be treated as strictly confidential.</p>
        <h4>Scope and Purpose of Data Collection</h4>
        <p>If you send us an application, we process your related personal data (e.g., contact and communication data, application documents, notes taken during interviews, etc.) to the extent that this is necessary for the decision on establishing an employment relationship. The legal basis for this is § 26 BDSG (German Federal Data Protection Act) according to German law (initiation of an employment relationship), Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR (general contract initiation), and – if you have given your consent – Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR. The consent can be revoked at any time. Within our company, your personal data will only be passed on to individuals involved in processing your application.</p>
        <p>If the application is successful, the data submitted by you will be stored in our data processing systems based on § 26 BDSG and Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR for the purpose of implementing the employment relationship.</p>
        <h4>Data Retention Period</h4>
        <p>If we are unable to make you a job offer, you reject a job offer, withdraw your application, revoke your consent to data processing, or request us to delete your data, the data transmitted by you, including any remaining physical application documents, will be stored or retained for a maximum of 6 months after the completion of the application process (retention period) to be able to understand the details of the application process in the event of discrepancies (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR).</p>
        <p>YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT TO THIS STORAGE IF YOUR LEGITIMATE INTERESTS OUTWEIGH OUR INTERESTS.</p>
        <p>After the retention period has expired, the data will be deleted unless there is a legal obligation to retain it or another legal basis for further storage exists. If it becomes apparent that the retention of your data will be necessary after the retention period has expired (e.g., due to an impending or ongoing legal dispute), the data will only be deleted when the data has become irrelevant. Other statutory retention periods remain unaffected.</p>
